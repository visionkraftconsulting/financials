Appended a new section describing the endpoint and the exact column layout:

    ## Importing User Investments from Excel

    You can bulk-import your existing investments by uploading an Excel file to the backend.
The file must be sent as `multipart/form-data` to the
`/api/investments/user_investments/import` endpoint with the field name `file`.

    The first sheet of the Excel workbook must have a header row with the following columns:

    | Column           | Required | Description                                     |
    | ---------------- | -------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
    | symbol           | Yes      | Ticker symbol (e.g. AAPL, MSFT)                 |
    | shares           | Yes      | Number of shares purchased                      |
    | invested_at      | Yes      | Purchase date (YYYY-MM-DD)                      |
    | track_dividends  | No       | TRUE/FALSE to track dividends (default: TRUE)   |
    | type             | No       | Investment type (stock, etf, crypto; default: stock) |
    | usd_invested     | No       | USD amount initially invested (default: 0)      |

    Imported rows will be added to your portfolio and cached metrics will be invalidated so 
that calculations update automatically.
